Reactive Forms:
Import ReactiveFormsModule in app.module.ts

Setting up form:
In HTML: For form element, assign [formGroup]="employeeForm", for form controls(fields), use formControlName="fname", formControlName="lname", etc.
In TS: Create a variable of type FormGroup, inside it would be a key value pair of form Controls with null as deafult value. If default value needs to be specified like CountryName/Gender selected on page load, define that instead of null like -->  country: new FormControl('India'),
eg:  this.employeeForm = new FormGroup({
      fname: new FormControl(null),
      lname: new FormControl(null)})

Validations:
In TS: 2nd param of FormControl object is validators, it contains required, email, max, min, etc.
If more than one validator needs to be specified, it should be specified in array like: new FormControl(null, [Validators.required, Validators.email])
There is an errors property on each form control which lists all the errors. It has keys like required, email, etc.
Ti display error msg in HTML, use get('formControlName') like ngIf="employeeForm.get('fname').invalid
FormGroup has its own valid and other properties like FormControls, form submission using button can be controlled using FormGroups valid property.
