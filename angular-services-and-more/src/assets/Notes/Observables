Promise is a JS Concept however Observable is provided by RxJS library.

For processing large amount of data aynchronously, the data is divided into data streams (Consider 1 GB data transfer divided into 10 packets of 100 MB each). These 10 packets are called stream of data.

Observable is a function that converts ordinary stream of data into an Observable one i.e. its a wrapper around stream of data.

Observable is based on Observable Pattern which consists of (see img Observable/.png and Promise vs Observable.png):
1. Observable -> Event Emitter (emits the data) -> It sends next/error/completion event
2. Observer -> Event Listener / Subscriber (listens to data) -> it subscribes to event sent by observable
3. Handler -> Event handler based on subscription of data -> It performs event handing based on type received like next/error/completion

Once an observable emits an error, it cannot emit any value after that. Same happens for complete method.
