Dynamic component is a cmp that is rendered dynamically by angular, lets say on a button clikc we want to show a pop-up which is a component in itself. Its not an angular feature, we just write a code to call it dynamically. Can be done by adding an ng-If to a selector or by using dynamic component loader(discontinued in newer versions).
