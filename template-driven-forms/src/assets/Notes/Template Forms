Template Driven Forms:
Import Forms Module for the form will be treated as template driven.
Change the button on form to type = "submit" and add (ngSubmit) to form element.
Add template reference variable to ngForm and assign ngForm to it like #formRef = "ngForm", this will allow form to be accessed as json in component class.
Access form element using ViewChild and assign type as ngForm, this value can be read on button click.
At this moment, controls and values object will be empty in ngForm object.

For controls to be created in ngForm:
Add a name to each element.
Assign ngModel attribute to each of them. This will create controls with name specified.
Form has values array which contain values against each form element.
It also has FormControls which contains properties such as dirty, touched, valid, etc.
If an element is focused, touched is true else untouched is true.
If value is changed, dirty is true else pristine is true.
If value is valid, valid is true else invalid is true.
