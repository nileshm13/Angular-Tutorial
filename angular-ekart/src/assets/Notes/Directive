Directive:
Angular directive gets assigned as an attribute to a template element.
It has filename as SetBackground.directive.ts

Directive class needs to be decorated with @Directive attribute and selecto should specify name in square brackets like:
@Directive
export class setBackground 
(
    selector: [setBackground]
){}

When a directive is assigned to a template element, reference of that element gets passed on to the constructor of directive as a parameter. User can manipulate the element as a template reference variable by using it.

Directive must be declared in the declarations array
