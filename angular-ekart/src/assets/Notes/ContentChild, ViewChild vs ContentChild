ContentChild:
ng-Content is when HTML contents are projected from parent to child component.
Parents have HTML with different contents, child has ng-content tag which gets replaced by Parent content.
The child content and parent content matching happens using class name, if no class name specified, all the content between selector tag keeps on overwriting ng-content and last one stays
@ContentChild is used to access HTML contents of parent in child usinng template reference variable, If there are two p Tags having same reference variable description2, only the first one will be referenced, First match stops searching process. Hence content of first p tag with #description2 gets displayed and second one is ignored.


For ViewChild/ContentChild, if reference is HTML Element, return type is ElementRef
For ViewChild/Content, if reference is a component reference, return type is Component
For ViewChildren/ContentChildren, return type is an array, its a QueryList<ElementRef> or QueryList<ComponentName>
ViewChild/ViewChildren is used to access HTML elements of its own template(HTML) or accessing child HTML component by parent
ContentChild/ContentChildren is used to access "Projected Content" from Parent to Child. This is projected using ng-content.
