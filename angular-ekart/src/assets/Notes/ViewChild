Template Referencing used above will only be available on button click, but what if we need it as soon as page laod, for it we use @ViewChild
  // @ViewChild allows us to access DOM, Directive or Component
  //   ViewChild(selector: string | Function | ProviderToken<unknown>, opts?: {
  //     read?: any;
  //     static?: boolean;
  // }): any
  selector - The directive type or the name used for querying.
  read - Used to read a different token from the queried elements.
  static - True to resolve query results before change detection runs, false to resolve after change detection. Defaults to false.

  When assiging to template variables, can use ElementRef as return type
