Using an ng-template in html does not mean it wil get rendered, it just means a template has been created and user
is free to use this template anywhere in the code.
In order to use this template, we need to add a template reference (using #) to ng-template and then define
"div *ngTemplateOutlet = "myTemplate" wherever the template #myTemplate is to be used.
